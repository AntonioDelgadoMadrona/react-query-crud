DEFINITION

For the realization of this Proof of Context I have done it with Vite, React and React-Query.

I decided to use Vite, for its speed and lightness. It is one of the options recommended by the React Official Docs.

FACILITY

React-Query-Crud_POC is developed in React with Vite, so for the installation of dependencies it is necessary to have Node and Vite. Once both are installed, go to the root of the project and run "npm install" to install all the necessary dependencies.

PERFORMANCE

To run the project on port 5173 it's necessary go to the root of the project and execute "npm run dev". If you go to http://127.0.0.1:5173/, You will see the application.
